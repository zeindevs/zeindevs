- 👋 Hi, I’m ZEN, I'm a full-time freelancer with 2+ years experience as a software engineer or full stack developer, so I can design and develop too. I am highly motivated and a hard worker, so I can spend more of my time just learning new technology if it's interesting to me and improving my skills in my job.
- 💼 I'm just working on a freelance project, but if I have opportunities, I'm currently open to working for any company to gain more experience and see how the tech industry is running.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with React.js, Vue.js, AstroJS, Node.js, Next.js, PHP, Laravel, Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Instagram/Twitter @zeindevs
- 📫 How to reach me Instagram/Twitter @zeindevs
